1 Last night I had the strangest dream
2 I sailed away to China
3 In a little row boat to find ya
4 And you said you had to get your laundry cleaned
5 Didn't want no one to hold you
6 What does that mean?
7 And you said
8 
9 Ain't nothin' gonna to break my stride
10 Nobody gonna slow me down, oh no
11 I got to keep on moving
12 Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
13 I'm running and I won't touch ground
14 Oh no, I got to keep on moving
15 
16 You're on the road and now you pray it lasts
17 The road behind was rocky
18 But now you're feeling cocky
19 You looked at me and you see your past
20 Is that the reason why you're runnin' so fast?
21 And she said
22 
23 Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
24 Nobody gonna slow me down, oh no
25 I got to keep on moving
26 Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
27 I'm running and I won't touch ground
28 Oh no, I got to keep on moving
29 
30 work me over
31 (Never let another girl like you) drag me under
32 (If I meet another girl like you) I will tell her
33 (Never want another girl like you) have to say, oh
34 
35 Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
36 Nobody gonna slow me down
37 Oh no, oh no, I got to keep on moving
38 Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
39 I'm running and I won't touch ground
40 Oh no, I got to keep on moving
41 
42 Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
43 Nobody gonna slow me down
44 Oh no, oh no, I got to keep on moving
45 Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
46 I'm running and I won't touch ground
47 Oh no, I got to keep on moving
48 
49 Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
50 Nobody gonna slow me down
51 Oh no, I got to keep on moving
52 Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
53 I'm running and I won't touch ground
54 Oh no, I got to keep on moving...
