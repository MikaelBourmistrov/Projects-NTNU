Last night I had the strangest dream
I sailed away to China
In a little row boat to find ya
And you said you had to get your laundry cleaned
Didn't want no one to hold you
What does that mean?
And you said

Ain't nothin' gonna to break my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down, oh no
I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving

You're on the road and now you pray it lasts
The road behind was rocky
But now you're feeling cocky
You looked at me and you see your past
Is that the reason why you're runnin' so fast?
And she said

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down, oh no
I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving

work me over
(Never let another girl like you) drag me under
(If I meet another girl like you) I will tell her
(Never want another girl like you) have to say, oh

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no, oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no, oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving

Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh no, I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride
I'm running and I won't touch ground
Oh no, I got to keep on moving...
